## Automatic theme changer for Linux applications

This app will change the theme for a collection of linux applications to a randomly chosen base16 theme. It uses
the base16-builder to select a theme and generate the theme files, then applies those files to the system. It does
not override any existing config files, but instead edits them carefully so you don't lose your other settings.
